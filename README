MSP is a C++ template class oriented to digital signal processing such as image manipulation, computer vision, biometry and so on .
Actually the main core is the "Matrix" class, with many doxy-documented features such as :

    * Addition/subtraction mask applying .
    * Saving and loading feature from/to any image format .
    * Selective or adaptive resize .
    * Low-pass/high-pass filters .
    * Orientation mask computation .
    * Gabor operator and enhancement .
    * Entropy computaiton .
    * Prewitt edge detector .
    * Hit-and-miss image thinning .
    * Frequency map computing and histogram computing .
    * Blurring and softening .
    * Dilate & erode .
    * Mean, variance, deviance, etc .
    * Binarization and normalization .
    * Image integration.
    * Biometric features such as fingerprint features recognition and matching .
	* Back-propagation neural network features .
	* And so on, and on, and on :D
